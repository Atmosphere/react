<p>The <strong>wes</strong> (Web Event Source) is an event-driven abstraction layer for various web application platforms that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. An embeddable web application written with <strong>wes</strong> can run on any supported platform, on Java, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of application and users can choose the desired framework to run application.</p>
